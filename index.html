<h3>The Story of Violet</h3>​
	<p>During the summer of 2014, my two black lab-boxer mixes passed away.  They had been a part of my life for nearly sixteen years and losing them was incredibly difficult.  For the next year, my family and I mourned our loss and attempted to move past it.  In May of 2015, my dad and I decided it was time to begin the search for new dog.  For nearly three months, we visited shelters at least once a week but we could not find a dog that we could all agree on.  Eventually, I gave up hope and refused to go to anymore shelters.</p>
	<p>A few weeks later, I was in my room when I hear jingling coming up the stairs.  I opened my door and in ran the tiniest puppy I had ever seen.  She was running around my room, smelling everything she could reach.  My dad was in my doorway with a huge grin as he explained that this was Violet and she was the puppy that he had gone to visit multiple times.  He had decided that he couldn’t keep leaving the shelter without her so he decided to adopt her.  I was upset at first because the dog was supposed to be a joint decision between us but any negative feelings I had quickly melted away the more time I spent with Violet.</p>​

<h4>FurKids</h4>
	<p>We adopted Violet from a shelter called FurKids.  It is a no-kill shelter based in Atlanta that works hard to give animals the best possible home.  The adoption process includes a good amount of paperwork and even a home visit to make sure that the animal will be going to a safe and loving environment.</p>
